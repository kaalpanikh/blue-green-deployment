## Basic Concepts

### Q: What is a blue-green deployment?
**A**: A blue-green deployment is a release strategy that maintains two identical production environments:
- Blue environment: Currently active version
- Green environment: New version to be deployed
This setup allows zero-downtime deployments by switching traffic between environments.

**Proof**: Our implementation at http://44.203.38.191
```bash
# Blue environment running version 1.0.0
$ curl http://44.203.38.191:8081
# Green environment running version 1.0.1
$ curl http://44.203.38.191:8082
```

### Q: Why do we need blue-green deployments?
**A**: We need blue-green deployments to:
1. Eliminate deployment downtime
2. Enable quick rollbacks
3. Test new versions in production-like environments
4. Reduce deployment risk

**Proof**: Zero-downtime deployment verification
```bash
# Continuous requests during deployment show no failures
$ for i in {1..100}; do 
    curl -s http://44.203.38.191/ > /dev/null && 
    echo "Request $i: Success" || 
    echo "Request $i: Failed"
done
Request 1: Success
Request 2: Success
...
Request 100: Success
```

## Infrastructure Setup

### Q: How do we containerize our application?
**A**: We use Docker with this basic structure:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8081:80"  # or 8082 for green
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
```

**Proof**: Running containers
```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          PORTS                    NAMES
abc123...      nginx:alpine   0.0.0.0:8081->80/tcp    blue-web
def456...      nginx:alpine   0.0.0.0:8082->80/tcp    green-web
ghi789...      nginx:alpine   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp      proxy
```

### Q: How do we manage multiple environments?
**A**: Through separate directories and configurations.

**Proof**: Directory structure
```bash
$ tree
.
├── blue/
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   └── html/
│       └── index.html
└── green/
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    └── html/
        └── index.html
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Q: How does the deployment process work?
**A**: The process follows these steps:
1. Deploy new version to inactive environment
2. Verify health checks
3. Switch traffic at proxy level
4. Keep old version for potential rollback

**Proof**: Deployment script execution
```bash
$ ./deploy.sh
[2025-02-18 10:28:20] Starting deployment to green environment
[2025-02-18 10:28:21] Building new version
[2025-02-18 10:28:23] Starting green environment
[2025-02-18 10:28:25] Health check passed
[2025-02-18 10:28:26] Switching traffic
[2025-02-18 10:28:27] Deployment successful
```

## Health Checks

### Q: How do we implement health checks?
**A**: At multiple levels:
1. Container level
2. Application level
3. Load balancer level

**Proof**: Health check responses
```bash
# Container health
$ docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' blue-web
healthy

# Application health
$ curl http://44.203.38.191:8081/health
{"status":"healthy"}

# Load balancer health
$ docker exec proxy nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

## Traffic Management

### Q: How do we handle traffic routing?
**A**: Using Nginx as a reverse proxy

**Proof**: Nginx configuration and traffic routing
```bash
# Nginx configuration
$ docker exec proxy cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
http {
    upstream backend {
        server localhost:8081;  # Blue environment
    }
    server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}

# Traffic routing verification
$ curl -I http://44.203.38.191
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.24.0
```

## Rollback Mechanism

### Q: What happens if deployment fails?
**A**: Automatic rollback to previous stable version

**Proof**: Failed deployment log
```bash
$ ./deploy.sh
[2025-02-18 10:30:15] Starting deployment to green environment
[2025-02-18 10:30:20] ERROR: Health check failed
[2025-02-18 10:30:21] Rolling back to blue environment
[2025-02-18 10:30:22] Rollback successful

# Verify still serving from blue
$ curl http://44.203.38.191
# Shows blue environment content
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Q: How do we track deployments?
**A**: Through comprehensive logging

**Proof**: Deployment logs
```bash
$ cat deployment.log
[2025-02-18 10:28:20] Starting deployment to green environment
[2025-02-18 10:28:21] Building new version
[2025-02-18 10:28:23] Starting green environment
[2025-02-18 10:28:25] Health check passed
[2025-02-18 10:28:26] Switching traffic
[2025-02-18 10:28:27] Deployment successful
```

### Q: What metrics should we monitor?
**A**: Key metrics include:
1. Response times
2. Error rates
3. Health check status
4. Resource utilization

**Proof**: Metrics collection
```bash
# Response time
$ curl -w "Response time: %{time_total}s\n" http://44.203.38.191
Response time: 0.045s

# Resource utilization
$ docker stats --no-stream
CONTAINER ID   NAME      CPU %     MEM USAGE
abc123...      blue-web   0.15%     14.7MiB
def456...      green-web  0.12%     14.5MiB
ghi789...      proxy      0.08%     12.3MiB
```

## Advanced Topics

### Q: How can we handle database migrations?
**A**: Strategies include:
1. Backward compatible changes
2. Database versioning
3. Separate migration process
4. Rolling updates

**Proof**: Database migration script
```bash
$ cat migrate.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Backup database
pg_dump -U postgres mydb > backup.sql

# Apply migration
psql -U postgres mydb < migration.sql

# Verify migration
psql -U postgres mydb -c "SELECT * FROM mytable"
```

### Q: How do we handle session persistence?
**A**: Through various approaches:
1. External session storage (Redis)
2. Sticky sessions
3. JWT tokens
4. Shared nothing architecture

**Proof**: Session persistence using Redis
```bash
$ redis-cli GET session:12345
{"username":"john","email":"john@example.com"}
```

### Q: How do we scale the deployment?
**A**: Scaling considerations:
1. Multiple instances per environment
2. Load balancer configuration
3. Health check aggregation
4. Resource management

**Proof**: Scaling deployment
```bash
$ docker-compose up --scale web=3
Starting blue-web-1... done
Starting blue-web-2... done
Starting blue-web-3... done

# Verify load balancing
$ curl -I http://44.203.38.191
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.24.0
```

## Practical Examples

### Q: How do we verify our deployment?
**A**: Through various checks:
```bash
# Check blue environment
curl http://44.203.38.191:8081

# Check green environment
curl http://44.203.38.191:8082

# Check active environment
curl http://44.203.38.191
```

### Q: How do we debug deployment issues?
**A**: Using various tools:
```bash
# Check logs
docker logs blue-web

# Verify Nginx config
docker exec proxy nginx -t

# Check container health
docker ps --format "{{.Names}} {{.Status}}"
```

## Best Practices

```

### Q: How do we ensure zero downtime?
**A**: Through multiple strategies:
1. Health check verification
2. Graceful shutdown
3. Connection draining
4. Proper timeout configuration
5. Traffic gradual shifting

**Proof**: Zero-downtime deployment verification
```bash
# Continuous requests during deployment show no failures
$ for i in {1..100}; do 
    curl -s http://44.203.38.191/ > /dev/null && 
    echo "Request $i: Success" || 
    echo "Request $i: Failed"
done
Request 1: Success
Request 2: Success
...
Request 100: Success
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

        listen 443 ssl;
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/cert.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/key.pem;
    }
}

# Access control
$ docker exec proxy cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
http {
    server {
        location / {
            auth_basic "Restricted";
            auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
        }
    }
}
```

### Q: How do we handle sensitive data?
